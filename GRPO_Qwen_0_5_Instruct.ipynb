        "In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to build a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline using the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method to finetune a language model for math, logic, and coding tasks. These are tasks for which there exist a unique correct answer that can be easily verified with the ground truth answer using a simple string comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "GRPO was used in the DeepSeek R1 and R1-Zero models. You will find a detailed overview of GRPO and how R1 and R1-Zero were trained in [this article](https://thelmbook.com/articles/#!./DeepSeek-R1.md).\n",
        "\n",
        "Our objective of this tutorial is to transform a generalist language model into a math problem solver. We integrate several popular libraries and tools, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PyTorch:** For tensor operations and deep learning.\n",
        "- **Hugging Face Transformers:** For loading pre-trained language models and tokenizers.\n",
        "- **TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning):** For configuring and running the GRPO training loop.\n",
        "- **FlashAttention2:** For optimized attention mechanisms that help reduce memory usage and improve training speed.\n",
        "- **Weights & Biases (wandb):** For experiment tracking, visualization, and model versioning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tutorial is organized into several parts. We start with the basic setup and imports, then move on to data formatting and answer extraction, dataset preparation, evaluation functions, reward functions, training setup and execution, and finally loading and testing the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Basic Setup and Imports\n",
        "\n",
        "In this first part, we install and import all necessary modules. We also set up our environment by configuring random seeds for reproducibility and initializing environment variables required for experiment tracking. In addition, we install and import libraries that provide optimized transformer attention mechanisms (FlashAttention2) and specialized RL tools (TRL):"

        "The problem with finetuning a model as small as Qwen-0.5B-Instruct is that it's too small to consistently follow out instruction given in the system prompt to generate the `<reasoning>` and `<answer>` tags. Without these tags, we cannot generate the reward for giving the right answer. We need to help the model a little bit in the beginning. For this, I generated a dataset of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sequences for some of the `gsm8k` examples. We will use 500 of them to finetune the model in a supervised (SFT) way to teach it using `<reasoning>` and `<answer>` tags before we apply the reinforcement learning.\n",

        "\n",
        "Doing this supervised finetuning step isn't mandatory, but it will accelerate the reinforcemement learning step because more answers generated by the model will have the `<reasoning>` and `<answer>` tag which will result in more reinformcement steps in positive reward starting from the very early steps, where the model is the less capable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, for relatively \"dumb\" models like Qwen-0.5-Instruct, not doing the preliminary SFT will most likely result in model not learning at all because it never generates the answer inside the `<answer>` tag."

The average reward for putting the correct answers into the `<answer>` tag plateaued around 0.6, which is low, compared to the maximum of 2.0. This can be explained by the small size of our model and a very low allowed response length we used (300).
